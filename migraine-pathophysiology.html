  <p>
    Migraine is among the most prevalent neurological disorders worldwide, yet it
    remains widely misunderstood. Historically described as a vascular headache,
    migraine is now recognized as a disorder of brain function involving altered
    sensory processing and neural excitability.
  </p>

  <h3>Brain Excitability and Migraine</h3>
  <p>
    Neurophysiological studies demonstrate that individuals with migraine exhibit
    heightened cortical responsiveness to sensory stimuli. This abnormal excitability
    predisposes the brain to attacks triggered by internal or external factors.
  </p>

  <h3>Cortical Spreading Depression</h3>
  <p>
    Cortical spreading depression represents a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization
    that travels across the cerebral cortex. It is closely associated with migraine aura
    and contributes to changes in pain perception and cerebral blood flow.
  </p>

  <h3>The Trigeminovascular Pathway</h3>
  <p>
    Activation of the trigeminovascular system results in the release of neuropeptides,
    particularly calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP plays a central role in
    migraine pain transmission, neurogenic inflammation, and central sensitization.
  </p>

  <h3>Clinical Relevance</h3>
  <p>
    Advances in understanding migraine mechanisms have led to targeted therapies,
    including CGRP antagonists and neuromodulation strategies. These treatments represent
    a shift from nonspecific pain control to mechanism-based management.
  </p>

  <h3>Implications for Medical Education</h3>
  <p>
    Recognizing migraine as a neurological disorder encourages evidence-based diagnosis
    and reduces stigma. For medical students, this framework supports rational treatment
    planning and patient-centered care.
