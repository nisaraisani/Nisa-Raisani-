    <details>
      <summary>What conditions do you treat?</summary>
      <p>
        I provide consultation and management for neurological conditions including
        migraine and headache disorders, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, memory and
        cognitive disorders, anxiety related neurological symptoms, and general
        neurological complaints.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you provide online consultations?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. Online consultations are available for selected cases.
        These are intended for medical guidance, follow-up care,
        and second opinions. Emergency conditions require immediate
        in-person medical attention.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Is this consultation a replacement for emergency care?</summary>
      <p>
        No. Online or outpatient consultations do not replace emergency services.
        If you experience sudden weakness, loss of consciousness, seizures,
        severe headache, or vision loss, seek emergency medical care immediately.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I get medical advice through email or WhatsApp?</summary>
